The title requires the sequester to take place in FY2018 and FY2019 as if the amendments that this title makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made. </p> <p>It also extends the sequester for mandatory spending through FY2027 (currently through FY2025) and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare. </p> <p>(Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.) </p> <p>(Sec. 30102) This section resets the balances on the scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to zero. </p> <p>(Sec. 30103) After April 15, 2018, but not later than May 15, 2018, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this bill.

H.R. 1551,https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1551,115th Congress (2017-2018),Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act,"Rice, Tom [Rep.-R-SC-7]",Republican,03/15/2017,Became Public Law No: 115-264.,10/11/2018,"<p><b>Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act</b></p> <p>This bill updates copyright law by creating a new compulsory licensing system for digital music services that transmit sound recordings. It also provides for federal protection to sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which are currently only covered by state law. It also authorizes royalties for producers, mixers, and sound engineers that made a creative contribution to a sound recording.</p> <p>TITLE I--Music Licensing Modernization</p> <p><i>Musical Works Modernization Act</i></p> <p>Compulsory licensing systems allow a person or company to use a copyright-protected work by agreeing to pay a set rate, without having to negotiate with or get explicit permission from the rights holder.</p> <p>This title updates requirements for compulsory licenses for sound recordings. It establishes a new compulsory licensing system that is explicitly available to digital music service providers, where it was unclear whether previously available compulsory licenses granted the rights needed by such services.</p> <p>Under this title, compulsory licenses are available for sound recordings that have previously been distributed to the public. If the recording has not been publicly distributed, a digital music service can get a license for the recording with the permission of the owner of the distribution right.</p> <p>The new compulsory license is called a blanket license, which covers essentially all publicly distributed sound recordings. It gives the licensee the right to make and distribute digital copies of the recordings, along with reasonable and necessary activities such as making server and incidental reproductions. The blanket license shall be available January 1, 2021. </p> <p>When the blanket license becomes available, it shall replace any compulsory licenses that the digital music service provider had previously obtained. </p> <p>If a digital music provider and rights holder has a voluntary agreement in place, in most instances that voluntary agreement shall remain in effect even after the blanket license becomes available. </p> <p>The Copyright Office shall designate a nonprofit entity to administer the blanket license, which the bill refers to as the mechanical licensing collective.</p> <p>The collective's duties include:</p> <ul> <li>offering and administering blanket licenses, and collecting and distributing royalties;</li> <li>maintaining a musical works database with information needed to run the system;</li> <li>handling requests to claim ownership of copyrights, and devising a method for distributing royalties for works with unknown owners;</li> <li>collecting administrative assessments from digital music providers and other licensees to support the collective's functions;</li> <li>enforcing rights and obligations under the license; and</li> <li>maintaining and providing necessary information for proceedings to set royalty rates and assessments.</li> </ul> <p>Digital music service providers seeking a blanket license shall notify the mechanical licensing collective of its activities that fall under the license. The license shall go into effect within 30 days of the collective receiving the notice, unless the collective issues a written rejection explaining its reasons. The collective can only reject a notice of license if the provider has had a blanket license terminated in the past three years, or if the notice fails to meet statutory or legal requirements.</p> <p>If a digital music provider makes and distributes recordings without a license, it shall be barred from getting a blanket license for three years.</p> <p>The mechanical licensing collective shall establish a publicly-searchable database with information including the title of the recording, the copyright owners and ownership percentages of each, and the owners' contact information. The database shall also have entries for recordings where the ownership information is unknown or incomplete.</p> <p>Copyright owners shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide information about their recordings for the database.</p> <p>The mechanical licensing collective shall collect and distribute royalties based on usage reports provided by the digital service providers. For recordings with unknown copyright holders, the collective shall place the collected royalties in an interest-bearing account. After three years, the unknown owner royalties and accrued interest shall be distributed to the known copyright holders in the database, with each receiving a portion based on their relative market shares. The copyright holders shall pay no less than 50% of the unclaimed royalties to songwriters.</p> <p>The licensees shall make monthly royalty payments to the collective and submit reports about its usage of musical works covered by the blanket license. </p> <p>A digital music service provider shall be in default if it misses a monthly royalty payment or report, fails to pay an administrative assessment, or breaches another material term of the blanket license. The mechanical licensing collective shall notify the provider in writing of the default, and that the license shall automatically terminate in 60 days unless the service provider fixes the defects. </p> <p>The bill requires licensees with significant non-blanket activities to report their monthly usage data to the mechanical licensing collective and pay an administrative assessment to help support the collective's activities. These significant non-blanket licensees are typically large licensees that took voluntary licenses with rights holders rather than, or alongside, a blanket license.</p> <p>The Copyright Office shall also designate a nonprofit entity to coordinate the licensees' activities with the music collective. This digital licensee coordinator's duties include helping the mechanical licensing collective collect administrative assessments, and gathering and maintaining information for use in proceedings to set the blanket license royalty rates.</p> <p>The Copyright Royalty Board shall hold proceedings to set the administrative assessment rates, based on the mechanical licensing collective's costs.</p> <p>The board shall also hold proceedings to set the rates and terms for the blanket license that most clearly represent what would have been negotiated in the marketplace, and based on economic and competitive information presented by the parties. The mechanical licensing collective and digital licensee coordinator shall not participate directly in the rate setting proceeding, but may gather and provide economic and usage data for the parties.</p> <p>Compulsory licenses used for reproduction and distribution rights shall in most instances be automatically substituted for the blanket license when it becomes available. Compulsory licenses for making and distributing permanent downloads will not convert to the blanket license until the record company terminates the license.</p> <p>Voluntary licensing agreements shall remain in effect after the blanket license becomes available.</p> <p>This title also temporarily limits the liability of digital music service providers for unlicensed uses on or after January 1, 2018. For unlicensed uses that fall within the blanket license, copyright holders shall only recover the royalty they would have received. To take advantage of this limited liability, the service provider must make monthly attempts to identify the rights holders of the relevant recordings and pay royalties to them. For unidentified rights holders, the music provider must calculate and collect the royalties, to be paid to the mechanical licensing collective when the blanket license becomes available.</p> <p>TITLE II--Classics Protection and Access </p> <p><i>Classics Protection and Access Act</i></p> <p>This title provides federal protection for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, which are currently only covered by state law.</p> <p>Sound recordings first published before 1923 shall be protected through 2021. Recordings from 1923 to 1946 shall be protected through the end of the year that is 100 years from the date of first publication. Recordings from 1947 to 1956 shall be protected through the end of the year that is 110 years from first publication. Recordings fixed after 1956 and before February 15, 1972, shall be protected until February 15, 2067.</p> <p>Owners of copyrights for pre-1972 recordings shall receive royalties for digital audio transmissions and reproductions. These royalties shall be paid in accordance with already-established statutory licensing schemes for post-1972 sound recordings.</p> <p>This title also allows for the noncommercial use of orphan works, which are sound recordings with unidentified rights owners. The noncommercial use shall be allowed after the user makes a reasonable attempt to find the rights owner and fails to do so, and a public notice period to give the owner a chance to object to the use.</p> <p>To qualify for statutory damages or attorneys' fees in an infringement action involving pre-1972 recordings, the rights owner must file with the Copyright Office a notice with information about its claimed works. </p> <p>This title also preempts most state law claims involving pre-1972 sound recordings. <br> <br> TITLE III--ALLOCATION FOR MUSIC PRODUCERS</p> <p><i>Allocation for Music Producers Act or the AMP Act</i> </p> <p>This title provides statutory authority for and expands existing practices for distributing royalties to producers, mixers, and sound engineers who made a creative contribution to a sound recording. A nonprofit collective designated by the Copyright Royalty Board shall adopt procedures for such royalty payments for various digital transmissions of the recording.</p> <p>The procedures shall allow the owner of the exclusive right to publicly perform the sound recording or the featured artist to instruct the collective to calculate and distribute the payments to the producers, mixers, and sound engineers. The instruction is called a &quot;letter of direction.&quot;</p> <p>For sound recordings fixed before November 1, 1995, the nonprofit collective shall adopt policies for collecting and distributing such royalties, even without a letter of direction. The collective and those seeking royalties shall attempt to contact the featured artist to get a letter of direction. However, if the artist does not object within a specified time frame, the collective may distribute the royalties.</p> <p>This title preempts state laws that may otherwise apply, such as those related to abandoned property or escheatment.</p> <p>"

The bill: (1) repeals the performance-based compensation and commission exceptions, (2) modifies the definition of &quot;covered employee,&quot; and (3) expands the definition of &quot;publicly held corporation.&quot; </p> <p>The bill includes an exception for compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date. </p> <p>(Sec. 13602) This section imposes an excise tax on excess tax-exempt organization executive compensation. The tax is equal to the product of the corporate tax rate (21% under this bill) and the sum of: (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an applicable tax-exempt organization for a taxable year, and (2) any excess parachute payment (separation pay), as specified in the bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 13603) This section allows qualified employees to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, income attributable to certain stock transferred to the employee by an employer. </p> <p>Employees are excluded if they: (1) are a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation or have been at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years; (2) are a family member of the specified individuals; or (3) is one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation or has been during any of the 10 preceding taxable years. </p> <p>(Sec. 13604) This section increases from 15% to 20% the excise tax imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatriated corporation. </p> <p>Subpart B--Retirement Plans </p> <p>(Sec. 13611) This section repeals the rule that allows Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) contributions to one type of IRA (traditional or Roth) to be recharacterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA. </p> <p>(Sec. 13612) This section increases the limit on accruals that is required for length of service award plans (LOSAPs) for bona fide volunteers to be exempt from treatment as a deferred compensation plan. </p> <p>(Under current law, plans paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers or their beneficiaries on the account of firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, and ambulance services performed by the volunteers are not treated as deferred compensation plans if they meet certain requirements. One of the requirements is a limit on the aggregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue with respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer.) </p> <p>The bill modifies the limit on accruals to: (1) increase the limit from $3,000 to $6,000; and(2) provide for a cost-of-living adjustment to the limit after 2017. </p> <p>In the case of LOSAPs that are defined benefit plans, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation. </p> <p>(Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A &quot;qualified plan loan offset amount&quot; is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant. </p> <p>Part VIII--Exempt Organizations </p> <p>(Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities. </p> <p>(Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income. </p> <p>(Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility. </p> <p>(Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights. </p> <p>(Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization. </p> <p>Part IX--Other Provisions </p> <p>Subpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform </p> <p>(Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period. This section does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 13802) This section lowers the excise tax rate on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or imported by the importer. </p> <p>For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to the importer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13803) This section allows the transfer of beer between bonded facilities without payment of tax if specified requirements are met. </p> <p>(Sec. 13804) This section modifies the credit against the excise tax on wine for small domestic for 2018 and 2019 to: </p> <ul> <li> make the credit available to all wine producers and importers by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation; </li> <li>establish credit rates of: (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine; </li> <li> establish adjusted credit rates for hard cider; and </li> <li> make sparkling wine producers and importers eligible for the credit. </li> </ul> <p>The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon. </p> <p>(Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for &quot;mead&quot; and &quot;low alcohol by volume wine&quot; that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine. </p> <p>(Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter. </p> <p>Members of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates. </p> <p>(Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax. This provision applies to distilled spirits transferred in bond after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2020. </p> <p>Subpart B--Miscellaneous Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 13821) This section modifies the tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, to: (1) allow an Alaska Native Corporation to assign certain payments referenced in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to a trust without including the payments in the gross income of the corporation, (2) allow the corporation to elect annually to deduct contributions made to a trust, (3) allow a trust to elect to defer the recognition of gains related to contributions of property other than cash until the sale or exchange of the property, and (4) establish information reporting requirements for deductible contributions to a trust. </p> <p>(Sec. 13822) This section exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. </p> <p>(Sec. 13823) This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held. </p> <p>Subtitle D--International Tax Provisions </p> <p>Under current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions. This subtitle establishes a territorial system in which foreign source income is not subject to regular U.S. taxes. </p> <p>Part I--Outbound Transactions </p> <p>Subpart A--Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14101) This section establishes a participation exemption system for foreign income. Under the system, the bill allows a 100% deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10% owned foreign corporations by domestic corporations that are U.S. shareholders of those foreign corporations. </p> <p>A &quot;specified 10% owned foreign corporation&quot; is any foreign corporation with respect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). </p> <p>No foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section. </p> <p>The bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction. </p> <p>(Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception. </p> <p>(Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation. </p> <p>For the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation. </p> <p>The bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes. </p> <p>The total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings. </p> <p>The tax may be paid in installments over eight years. </p> <p>The bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts. </p> <p>Subpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income </p> <p>Chapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income </p> <p>(Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year. The bill specifies a formula and requirements for calculating global intangible low-taxed income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14202) This section allows deductions for domestic corporations for specified portions of the corporation's foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income, using specified formulas and definitions included in the bill. </p> <p>Chapter 2--Other Modifications Of Subpart F Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14211) This section repeals provisions that treat foreign base company oil related income as category of subpart F income. </p> <p>(Sec. 14212) This section repeals the requirement for a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that invested previously excluded subpart F income in foreign base company shipping operations to include in income a pro rata share of the previously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases the investments </p> <p>(Sec. 14213) This section modifies the stock attribution rules for determining status as a CFC. Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. </p> <p>(Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply. </p> <p>Chapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion </p> <p>(Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of &quot;intangible property&quot; to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual. </p> <p>The bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property. </p> <p>The bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity. </p> <p>A &quot;disqualified related party amount&quot; is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid transaction&quot; is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax. </p> <p>A &quot;hybrid entity&quot; is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill </p> <p>(Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends. </p> <p>Subpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System </p> <p>(Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation. The bill allows a deemed-paid credit with respect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly attributable to the subpart F inclusion. </p> <p>(Sec. 14302) This section requires foreign branch income to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a U.S. person which are attributable to one or more qualified business units in one or more foreign countries. </p> <p>(Sec. 14303) This section requires gains, profits, and income from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States to be allocated and apportioned between sources within and without the United States solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the property. </p> <p>(Sec. 14304) This section allows an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss and recharacterized as foreign source. </p> <p>A &quot;Pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss'' is any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule for the recharacterization of overall domestic loss. </p> <p>Part II--Inbound Transactions </p> <p>(Sec. 14401) This section imposes on each applicable taxpayer for any taxable year a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year and specifies a formula for calculating the tax. </p> <p>An &quot;applicable taxpayer&quot; is a taxpayer who: (1) is a corporation other than a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (2) has average annual gross receipts of at least $500 million for the three-year period ending with the preceding year; and (3) has a base erosion percentage, as determined using a specified formula, of at least 3% (2% for certain banks and securities dealers). </p> <p>Part III--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 14501) This section modifies the exception from the passive foreign investment company rules for insurance businesses. The bill replaces the test based on whether a corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation's insurance liabilities. </p> <p>(Sec. 14502) This section specifies that all allocations and apportionments of interest expense must be determined using the adjusted bases of assets rather than on the basis of the fair market value of the assets or gross income. </p> <p>TITLE II </p> <p>(Sec. 20001) The Department of the Interior must establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. </p> <p>The bill specifies that the provision in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act that prohibits the production of oil and gas from ANWR does not apply to the Coastal Plain.</p> <p>Interior must conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Each lease sale must contain: (1) at least 400,000 acres, and (2) areas that have the highest potential for the discovery of hydrocarbons. </p> <p>Interior must also: (1) issue any necessary rights-of-way or easements across the Coastal Plain for the exploration, development, production, or transportation associated with the oil and gas program; and (2) authorize up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain to be covered by production and support facilities during the term of the leases under the oil and gas program. </p> <p>(Sec. 20002) This section amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to temporarily increase the annual limitation on offshore revenue sharing for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million annually for FY2020 and FY2021, to $650 million annually for those two years.</p> <p> (Sec. 20003) The Department of Energy (DOE) must: (1) draw down and sell seven million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during FY2026-FY2027, (2) deposit the amounts received from the sale in the Treasury, and (3) stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after $600 million has been deposited in the Treasury. </p> <p>DOE may not drawdown or sell oil under this section in quantity that would limit the authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage. </p>"

The bill eliminates the requirement that an employee participate in counseling and mediation before filing a claim with the OCWR alleging a violation. A hearing officer, appointed by the OCWR, must conduct a preliminary review of the claim to assess if the claimant is a covered employee and has stated a claim for which relief may be granted. Claimants who do not meet those criteria must be notified by the hearing officer that they may file a civil action in a U.S. district court within 90 days.</p> <p>Claimants who do meet the criteria may file a civil action in a U.S. district court within 70 days if they have not requested a hearing.

The employing office may also make another workplace adjustment or permit a remote work assignment that reduces interactions between the employee and any person alleged to have committed the CAA violation. In granting such paid leave of absence, the employing office may not require the employee to substitute his or her accrued paid vacation or personal leave. These provisions do not override a collective bargaining agreement.</p> <p>(Sec. 114) All information discussed or disclosed in mediation must be confidential.</p> <p>(Sec. 115) Noncongressional legislative offices that violate CAA requirements must reimburse the Treasury for resulting award or settlement payments.</p> <p>TITLE II--IMPROVING OPERATIONS OF OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL WORKPLACE RIGHTS</p>  <p>(Sec. 201) OCWR reporting requirements are modified for claims, awards, and settlements.
